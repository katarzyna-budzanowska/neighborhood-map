# Neighborhood map project

This is final project for Udacity Google Front-End Development Nanodegree Scholarship Program.

Neighborhood map is a presentation of interesting places one can visit in Wroc≈Çaw. One can select from three categories: restaurants, parks and monuments. Clicking on location in menu or pin on the map shows a list of pictures from that location. Images are dynamically queried from Flickr.

## Service Worker
Service worker is only available in production build. To see it in action please check the _npm run build_ script description.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

npm run build creates a build directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served index.html, and requests to static paths like /static/js/main.<hash>.js are served with the contents of the /static/js/main.<hash>.js file.
